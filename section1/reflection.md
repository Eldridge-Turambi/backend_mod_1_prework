## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I feel like I take breaks *early* and *often* and take care of my brain. What I want to do more of is read more; I want to be more detailed oriented when followung instructions while I am learning how to code. If i take the time to do this, I feel like I will learn better and absorb the information more effectively.


2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
````
puts "Hello World!"
````

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
````
#
````
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An **integer** is a number without a decimal and a **float** (2) is a number with a decimal (2.2)

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
````
animal = "zebra"
````

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
````
puts animal
````
7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is a proccess that lets you substitute a word or a phrase in a string with another variable that was assigned earlier.
````
puts "The #{animal} was eaten by the lion!"
````

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
````
desired_variable = gets.chomp
````
Use 'gets.chomp' after your 'desired_variable = " to gain input from the user.
9. Name and describe two common string methods:

* Use ".upcase" to capitalize every letter in a string
* Use ".length" to output the amount of charachters in a string (including spaces).

Section 1 is done!
