# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/interpolation.rb`

# Example: Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "The Chudley Cannons are Ron's favorite Quidditch team":
name = "Ron"
team = "Chudley Cannons"

puts "The #{team} are #{name}'s favorite Quidditch team"


# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
speedy = "quick red fox"
slow_poke = "lazy brown dog"

puts "The #{speedy} jumped over the #{slow_poke}." # YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string that reads
# "In a predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!":
slow_poke_1 = "tortoise"
speedy_1 = "hare"

puts "In a predicable result, the #{slow_poke_1} beat the #{speedy_1}!"# YOUR CODE HERE


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, name/content/data type of your choice. Think carefully about what you name the variables. Remember, the goal is to be concise but descriptive (it's a hard balance!) Then, log out ONE sentence that incorporates all THREE variables.

my_name = "Eldridge"
sandwich_type = "Turkey"
number_of_sandwiches = 3

puts "Yesterday, #{my_name} was so hungry that he made and ate #{number_of_sandwiches} sandwiches with #{sandwich_type} in it. Yum!"
